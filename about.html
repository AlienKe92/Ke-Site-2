    <h1> Where is it K-Way came from </h1>
    <p>
        Firstly, K-Way started from me learning to code through CodeAcademy, a great online training provider. <br>
        I was taught how to use WYSIWYG editors (what you see is what you get) such as Visual Studio Code. <br>
        Along with learning how to code with Python, HTML and CSS.<br>
        Secondly, but technically to be done first, was the planning via Trello or Diagrams to assist in the updating snd progress of my project<br>
        The idea for K-Way, well that comes from years of my own self experience and personal opinions.
    </p>

<h2> What it is we aim to succeed with at K-Way </h2>


<P> At K-Way, we aim to raise awareness, persistence and funding to protect our world from being completely irreversible. 
    <br>
        We want to give the newer generations a fighting chance to make something of themselves! We want that chance ourselves.<br>
        
        but we really cannot lead into a future if old operations continue to daily run. without consequences being thought of properly.</div>

         <br>
         <p> A picture can speak for itself, but take this picture of one tree being cut down,
             <br>
             <br> And multiply it to between 3.5 to 7 billion times. That is a lot of trees a year. Even healthy trees are caught up in it! <br>
             <br>
             Being destroyed for human demands0 There has to be something that could minimize the amount of mass deforestation. </p>
